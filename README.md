# SHARIBA

This app was created in 1,5 week by Babette, Sarith and Sharon. It's called Tipster and is created for travelers. The concept is that a local can add his or her favourite spot and its location to the app. A traveler who wants to see more than the basic tourist spots, can search Tipster for something original to visit!


What is already possible: <br>
- Register yourself <br>
- Login <br>
- View all cities and its city tips <br>
- Search for a city and view the city tips belonging to this specific city on one page

Some functionalities are still missing though, like adding a favourite spot and its location. Right now, if you open the app, every time new tables are created by loading them from database.js. Also, for really finishing more styling and content should be added.

<b>Fork this app</b>

4. For easy editing the app, do a "npm install nodemon" which allows you to edit the back-end and not having to restart your app each time with a node app.js.

<b>Enjoy!</b>
